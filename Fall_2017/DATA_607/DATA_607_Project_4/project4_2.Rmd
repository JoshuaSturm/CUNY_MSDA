```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warn = F, message = F)
options(stringsAsFactors = F)
```

## Import libraries
```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(wordcloud2)
library(tm)
library(quanteda)
library(RTextTools)
```

## Import files
```{r}
setwd("~/GitHub/CUNY_MSDA/Fall_2017/DATA_607/DATA_607_Project_4")

# Training Files
ham.one.dir <- list.files("easy_ham/", full.names = T, recursive = F)
spam.one.dir <- list.files("spam/", full.names = T, recursive = F)

# Testing Files
ham.two.dir <- list.files("easy_ham_2/", full.names = T, recursive = F)
spam.two.dir <- list.files("spam_2/", full.names = T, recursive = F)

# Combine testing files
comb <- c(ham.two.dir, spam.two.dir)
```

### Preview files
```{r}
head(readLines(ham.one.dir[1]), 10)
tail(readLines(ham.one.dir[1]), 10)
```

We can see that each email has a long head and footer. We only want to keep the time and body, so let's remove the irrelevant parts. It seems that there is usually a new line between header and body, so we can use regex to remove everything before that empty line.

## Clean files
```{r}
for (i in 1:length(comb)){
  read_f <- readLines(comb[i])
  read_f <- gsub("[[:space:]]*$", "", read_f)
}




```
